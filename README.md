# dbt-tutorial

This is my take on the starter eductaional project mentioned here
[Quickstart](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/quickstarts/dbt-core/quickstart)
using a docker postgresql container.

The code runs without problems and tests get executed without problems.
It differs from the tutorial but it is my take of course. Nothing is missing though.

Enjoy !!!
