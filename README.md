# dbt-tutorial

This is my take on the starter educational project mentioned here
[Quickstart](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/quickstarts/dbt-core/quickstart)
using a docker postgresql container.

The code runs without problems and tests get executed without problems.
It differs from the tutorial but it is my take of course. Nothing is missing though.

The action is in jaffle_shop folder, docker-compose.yml, dbt_project.yml and models

Enjoy !!!
