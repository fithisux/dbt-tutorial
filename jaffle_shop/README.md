>This is my take on the starter eductaional project mentioned here
[Quickstart](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/quickstarts/dbt-core/quickstart)
using a docker postgresql container.

>The code runs without problems and tests get executed without problems.
It differs from the tutorial but it is my take of course. Nothing is missing though.
